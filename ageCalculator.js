//INSTRUCTION: 
// Define a function called ageCalculator. This function should take 3 parameters:

// name – a string representing someone's name
// yearOfBirth – a number representing their year of birth
// currentYear – a number representing the current year
// Your ageCalculator function should return a string explaining how old the person is. For example, if we called ageCalculator("Suzie", 1983, 2015);, the return value should be as follows.
// "Suzie is 32 years old."



function ageCalculator(name, yearOfBirth, currentYear){
	var ageDifference = currentYear - yearOfBirth
	return name + " is " + ageDifference + " years old."
}


console.log(ageCalculator("Miranda", 1983, 2015));
console.log(ageCalculator("Ferdinand", 1988, 2015));
