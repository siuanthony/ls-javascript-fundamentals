//INSTRUCTION: 
// Another common structure for looping in JavaScript is the for loop. The idea of a for loop is very similar to a while, only all the code that relates to the state of the loop is written on one line. Create a new file called chorus-for.js and add to it the following code.

var chorus = "Let's dance!";
for (var repeat = 0; repeat < 10; repeat++) {
  console.log(chorus);
}
console.log("Until the sun comes up!");
